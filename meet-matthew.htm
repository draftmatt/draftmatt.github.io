      <h1>Meet Matthew</h1>
      
      <p>Matthew was born and raised in Markham (Unionville). His suburban roots and values were cultivated since his childhood. Not long after, Matthew moved to Thornhill, where he spent his formative years.</p>
<p>Matthew was educated at McGill University and currently studies law at the University of Toronto.</p>

      <h2>Humble Beginnings</h2>
      <p>Growing up as the son of Italian immigrants in Thornhill, Matthew embodies the Canadian dream. His parents came to Canada with a drive to succeed and not much else. They were proud to call Thornhill their home. As a child, Matthew played hockey with the children of Jewish, Chinese, Korean, and Iranian immigrants, along with many others. He understands that Canada is better because of our differences, not in spite of them.</p>
      
      <h2>Activism</h2>
      <p>Matthew has been an advocate for a better Canada since his undergraduate days.</p>

      <h2>An Everyman</h2>
      <p>At heart, Matthew is just an everyday, average guy. He doesn’t drive a fancy car, he doesn’t own a fancy house, he packs his lunch, and has a no-nonsense style. He’s extremely <strong>real</strong>. Expect a knock on the door from Matthew ask him to tell you more about his vision for Thornhill!</p>
